2. Product - The product that have been sold.
3. Quantity Ordered - Ordered Quantity is the total item quantity ordered in the initial order (without any changes).
4. Price Each - The price of each products.
5. Order Date - This is the date the customer is requesting the order be shipped.
6. Purchase Address - The purchase order is prepared by the buyer, often through a purchasing department. The purchase order, or PO, usually includes a PO number, which is useful in matching shipments with purchases; a shipping date; billing address; shipping address; and the request items, quantities and price.
